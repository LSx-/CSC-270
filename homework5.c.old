/*
 * The EulerLogic method.
 *
 * Here is where all of the hardwork for the computer will take place
 * The Euler logic is supposed to do palindrome and give us a product
 * that will be the "largest palindrome product" and the way to get this
 * is by doing multiplying  two 3 digit numbers into each other and they
 * MUST read back and forth the same way
 *
